			A problem with Athena is the process of registering for classes. Athena is a tool students use to register for classes. This relates to education since it gives students the ability to further their education. The issue of registering for classes mainly affects the students directly while affecting several stakeholders such as the professors and the university indirectly. There are several parts of a class that students are left unaware of when registering. Though all UGA students have to meet with their advisors before registering for classes to clear the academic advising hold, it is upon the student to seek out appropriate resources and ask the right questions they need answered. This article by the US Department of Education helps support this by stating why it is important to have an advisor which suggests that if there is a better system in place which advises students through an online tool, then students will be more successful (<a class = "links" href= "https://blog.ed.gov/2022/08/the-importance-of-academic-advising-in-higher-education/">Source</a>). In addition to this, there is only one advisor for all the graduate students in the School of Computing, making it more difficult to get hold of the advisor and have one’s questions answered in time. According to Patrick Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, “proper counseling keeps [students] taking the course that keeps them on a steady path towards graduation” (<a class = "links" href="https://www.mlive.com/education/2014/07/dude_wheres_my_advisor.html">Source</a>). This also suggests that if Athena was a tool which was better at advising than it currently is, then it would help students stay on the path to graduation.<br><br>
			
			Most students cannot determine the exact requirements of the class due to being unable to access the syllabus when signing up which means they are unaware of how likely they are to succeed in the course.This is an issue faced by many students around the world which sites like Rate My Professor attempts to solve, allowing students to not only make the decision to take a class based off of its content alone, but also the quality of the class, which is a highly valued component for many (<a class = "links" href="https://www.breezejmu.org/opinion/opinion-rate-my-professor-is-a-helpful-and-honest-website/article_7967f3d8-0328-11e9-93ec-ebc0a2c201e9.html">Source</a>). If the student’s schedule ends up being too difficult, they may have to retake courses which could lead to a longer time in college leading to a greater cost for the student (<a class = "links" href="https://edu.rsc.org/opinion/students-will-learn-more-if-theyre-interested/2010092.article">Source</a>). It could also affect their social life and mental health (<a class = "links" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28266232/">Source</a>).<br><br>
			
			Further, students are uninformed of how the class will further their careers and what they will specifically learn in them. Oftentimes, students are not able to select courses they are interested in due to a lack of seat availability. Students have to constantly keep checking to see if there is seat availability or usually set alarms and are constantly worried about it putting them in a stressful situation. For example, the author of a <a class = "links" href= "https://www.perkins.org/resource/coursicle-class-scheduling-app-review/#:~:text=Coursicle%20is%20a%20college%20course,in%20closed%20or%20waitlisted%20classes.">Coursicle app review</a> talks about how they had to set a timer that went off every fifteen minutes, 24 hours a day, to figure out when there were openings for the classes they wanted. This experience was tiring, frustrating, and incredibly stressful. This can be problematic later on because if a student cannot take a particular prerequisite class, then their graduation may be delayed. Another example is not being able to take a course you're interested in, then you might be forced to take another class that you might perform poorly in. These situations can cost you extra time, money, and mental stress. Indirectly, the school can be adversely affected since longer graduation times for the students can decrease graduation rates, which reflect poorly on the university, leading to potential decreases in partnerships, grant money, and decreases in applications. This will also reflect poorly on the professors potentially making the university seem poorer to outsiders, thereby decreasing their opportunities outside of the university.<br><br>
			
			Looking at the portal itself we noticed a few anti-affordances. When registering for a class, you are able to access the course information by clicking through certain gray tabs (property) on a modal like class details, meeting times, waitlist, etc. However, the tabs which are the signifiers for fees, syllabus, and bookstore links do not afford providing any useful information and also do not afford navigating to the correct links. 

			We believe addressing these issues in the course registration process will make a positive impact on students’ college experience.<br><br>

			We have broken down a few typical interactions with Athen using the <b>Seven Stages of Action</b> below:<br><br>
			
			<b>Grad student research</b><br>
			GOAL: The graduate student wants more guidance when registering for classes<br>
			PLAN: The student considers their options. They could try to contact the graduate coordinator, ask their peers for help, or do their own research on Athena and other UGA sites (like UGA Bulletin).<br>
			SPECIFY:  The student picks one of their options. In this case, they chose to not to contact the graduate coordinator as the coordinator’s email inbox is always full and it is hard to get hold of them. The student decides to do their own research.<br>
			PERFORM: The student navigates to Athena, browses the classes, creates a schedule, and registers for classes.<br>
			PERCEIVE: The user sees that they have successfully registered for their courses.<br>
			INTERPRET: The user feels a little satisfied thinking about how next semester will go taking these classes but is still a little worried because last semester’s schedule turned out to be super stressful.<br>
			COMPARE: The user’s interpretation of what they perceive leads them, in this case, to believe that they have not met their goal and would still like some guidance.<br><br>

			<b>Lack of syllabus availability</b><br>
			GOAL: The user wants to know the syllabus and course requirements of the class.<br>
			PLAN: The user uses UGA Bulletin to find past syllabi of the course. The user asks friends about course requirements.<br>
			SPECIFY: In this case the student doesn’t learn enough about course requirements from anecdotal evidence from their friends. As a result, the student views past course syllabi which are available on UGA Bulletin.<br>
			PERFORM: The user visits UGA Bulletin, navigates to their course and downloads the syllabi which are available.<br>
			PERCEIVE: The user views the information related to their class and are set at ease, having known this information. 
			INTERPRET: The user notices that the syllabi available are not from the professors currently teaching the course. Furthermore, they are several years old. The user is now unnerved due to potentially signing up for courses whose requirements will not be known until syllabus day.<br>
			COMPARE: The user did not meet their goal since they were unable to discern the exact course requirements related to the professor who will teach the course.<br><br>

			<b>Lack of information related to how class affects graduation and career</b><br>
			GOAL: The user wants to know how classes will affect their graduation and career.<br>
			PLAN: The user uses external websites such as ratemyprofessor to understand how easy/hard a class is.<br>
			SPECIFY: There is not enough information about classes on Athena and therefore a student will not know if they are interested in a class so they view ratemyprofessor to see if the class is interesting.<br>
			PERFORM: The user navigates to Athena, views the class and then navigates to Google to search ratemyprofessor with the class name.<br>
			PERCEIVE: The user sees what other students have said about the class and makes a decision to take the class based on these students.<br>
			INTERPRET: The user could make a decision based on a small sample size or not find any reviews on ratemyprofessor and have no information to make a decision. Therefore, the user will not know how the class will affect their graduation or career until they take the class.<br>
			COMPARE: The user did not meet their goal since they were unable to figure out which classes were interesting or beneficial to their career.<br><br>

			<b>Lack of ability to track seats</b><br>
			GOAL: The user wants to track the courses they want to take next semester.<br>
			PLAN: The user uses Athena to track potential courses for next year.<br>
			SPECIFY: The user has graduation requirements to meet and plans to track classes so he can take the ones which best fit.<br>
			PERFORM: The user navigates to Athena, views the classes they can take and is able to sign up for the waitlist of classes but is unable to track classes at the same time as these courses.<br>
			PERCEIVE: The user is unable to track all the classes they wanted to take and, as a result, will be unaware if there is an opening in certain classes.<br>
			INTERPRET: The user will have to get lucky to try to sign up for a class and hope that eventually it is open. If the user is unable to sign up for a course they may have to push their graduation back and spend more money in college.<br>
			COMPARE: The user did not meet their goal since they were left unaware of what classes they would be able to take.<br><br>

			<h2>B. Analysis of Existing Solutions</h2>
			<p style = "font-weight: 600;">
				Q1. Describe existing solutions.
				What existing solutions, products, and services currently relate to your problem of study? Have others already attempted 
				to solve your exact problem or something similar? What are the pros and cons of each existing solution, product, or service? 
				If a certain solution, product, or service is popular, then state that and justify why that’s the case – you might use published 
				surveys or articles to help make your case.<br>
				Q2. Describe potential guidelines and solutions. What guidelines or principles do these solutions, products, and services conform 
				to, either officially or unofficially, if any? What guidelines or principles appropriately serve your users?
			</p>
			<p>
				The existing solutions for one of the issues where minimal information is provided during the course of registration of classes is where the students have to do their own research about the subjects and professors through websites like Rate My Professor. The site is a useful tool for both students and professors since it allows students to provide “indirect feedback to their professors, giving future students insight into what their future classes may look like, as well as a tool for professors to receive informal feedback regarding their strengths and weaknesses as educators” (<a class = "links" href = "https://fitchburgpoint.com/12801/opinion/ratemyprofessor-bashing-or-useful/">Source</a>). The pros for Rate My Professor is that it is an open platform that allows students to express their opinion about professors and classes freely and anonymously. The site does have <a class = "links" href = "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/guidelines#:~:text=Reviews%20should%20focus%20specifically%20on,took%20away%20from%20the%20course." >official guidelines</a> to reinforce their mission of “provid[ing] a safe forum to share classroom experiences to help fellow students make critical education choices.” However, the con is that sometimes the website does not have information about certain professors, meaning the student has to go into the course blindly. 
				For the issue of not being able to access the syllabus, students usually ask others who have previously taken the course or navigate to the UGA bulletin website. In these cases, the students may not receive the correct and current syllabus since the UGA bulletin usually contains outdated syllabus. The UGA bulletin follows specific <a class = "links" href="https://www.usg.edu/siteinfo/web_content_guidelines">accessibility guidelines</a> as a member of the USG so that all web content published by the university is accessible to those with disabilities as well.  
				And lastly, to address the issue of not being able to select courses due to a lack of seat availability, many students use third party apps like Coursicle that lets you plan out your schedule and track classes that are full so that you can get notified when a spot opens up. Using apps such as this and also taking advantage of UGA’s waitlist process on Athena can be some ways students can still have classes they are interested in even when they get full. According to this TheRed&Black article, “though Coursicle competes with another program known as Courseoff, which also helps students plan their classes, there is no competitor specifically for Coursicle’s tracking feature” (<a class = "links" href = "https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/coursicle-app-helps-uga-students-with-organizing-class-registration/article_89636f24-e163-11e8-8594-83136c020131.html">Source</a>). Though the app itself is free, students would have to upgrade their account to premium if they would like to track more than one class at a time for a fee of three dollars. Moreover, since it is a third party app, Coursicle does not automate registering for classes, they just notify which classes are available.<br><br>
				
				The guidelines/principles that serve our users are discoverability- the user should easily know where to find information related to the class and they do by searching up these external websites. These existing solutions also employ principles of affordances, signifiers, and mappings specifying what menus and buttons users need to click to easily find information pertaining to a class.<br>
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h2>C. Proposed Solution</h2>
			<p style = "font-weight: 600;">
				Q1. Propose a solution.Using points from (A) and (B), propose a design solution to your problem of study. Do not propose a solution that’s in search of a problem! At this stage, let the problem lead you to a solution. Try to describe your solution using terms like properties, affordances, and signifiers. How does your proposed solution compare to existing solutions?<br>
				Q2.How will you measure success? You do not need to supply an evaluation for this milestone; however, you should discuss what criteria should be used to judge if your design is a success or not.
			</p>
			<p>
			One of solutions to the proposed problem would be to afford having more details regarding the course work such as affording to have a tab for an updated syllabus under the course. The course should also afford showing the rating of the professor and how the course flow would be under that professor. Another solution regarding the lack of seat availability would be to afford having an option to track classes and Athena should afford notifying students when seats are available so that they can still register for the classes they are interested rather than using an external app to do this and many students do not know the existence of an external app which makes this solution beneficial for students. Athena should also afford viewing information about the class related to how it affects their career and graduation. We can have signifiers such as buttons or tabs highlighting the syllabus, rate my professor and track my course under a particular course so that the users can easily access it and make good use of it.<br>
			
			All these affordances would help students choose their subjects having a clear idea rather than choosing blindly with minimal information which may or may not cause them to regret and could also negatively impact their future.<br>
			
			One of the main indicators which should be used to determine whether our design was a success or not should include an analysis of how the graduation rate changed after our design was implemented. A potential problem with this measure is it will be difficult to prove causation between our design change and the resulting graduation rate. Also, we can poll students and faculty to assess their satisfaction with the old vs. new designs. Other measures include looking at salary changes (adjusted for inflation), whether students attained their first choice careers and an analysis of how prepared they felt they were for their careers. Furthermore, looking at indirect consequences, we can look at professor satisfaction rates and we can look at if more students are applying to the university after the changes.<br>

			<h2>D. Summary Video</h2>
			<p style = "font-weight: 600;">
				Q1. Create a 5-10 minute video that summarizes the information in parts (A), (B), and (C). 
				The creation of this video should involve all team members, and the video itself should contain credits at the end describing who did what.<br>
