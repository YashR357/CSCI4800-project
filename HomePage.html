				<h2>SYNOPSIS OF PROBLEM STUDY</h2>
				<p>
					A problem with Athena is the process of registering for classes. Athena is a tool students use to register for classes. 
					There are several parts of a class that students are left unaware of when registering. Though all UGA students have to 
					meet with their advisors before registering for classes, it is upon the student to seek out appropriate resources and 
					ask the right questions they need to be answered. This can be even harder if there is a poor student-to-advisor ratio. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Most students cannot determine the exact requirements of the class due to being unable to access the syllabus when 
					signing up which means they are unaware of how likely they are to succeed in the course. If the student’s schedule ends 
					up being too difficult, they may have to retake courses which could lead to a longer time in college leading to a 
					greater cost for the student. It could also affect their social life and mental health. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Further, students are uninformed of how the class will further their careers and what they will specifically learn in 
					them. Oftentimes, students are not able to select courses they are interested in due to a lack of seat availability. 
					Students have to constantly keep checking to see if there is seat availability or usually set alarms and are constantly 
					worried about it putting them in a stressful situation.
				</p>
				<p>
					We believe addressing these issues in the course registration process will make a positive impact on students’ college experience.
